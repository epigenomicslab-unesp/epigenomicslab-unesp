# Epigenomics Research Lab üß¨
We are dedicated to exploring the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression and host-pathogen interactions through cutting-edge computational biology.

## Research Focus üî¨
Our work integrates experimental data and bioinformatics tools to investigate:

**DNA Methylation:** Epigenetic modifications and their role in gene regulation and disease.

**Non-coding RNAs:** Functional characterization of lncRNAs and miRNAs in diverse biological contexts. We also perform analyses to explore how genomic variants may influence the expression and function of these non-coding RNAs.

**RNA-Seq:** Transcriptomic analysis for understanding differential gene expression and splicing events.

## Repositories üìÅ
You will find scripts, workflows, and data related to our ongoing projects. We aim to share reproducible and well-documented code to contribute to the scientific community.
